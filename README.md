I'm a final year computational PhD candidate at the University of Leeds within the Aspden Group, looking at translation regulation of mRNA and lncRNA in neuronal differentiation using high-throughput sequencing data.

## I primarily work on
  - Nanopore long-read data
  - Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq data
  - Proteomics data

## Projects I’m currently working on
  - inspectorORF - An R package for the plotting of exons, introns, transcripts and coding sequences from multiomics data
    
## Personal projects
  - decapod-rs - A rust crate consisting of bindings around the pod5-file-format library in a Rust idomatic way
  - sandman-rs - A Rust crate for asynchronous reading of bed, bgzipped bed, and tabix indexed beds with automatic detection of compression and indexed beds.
  - faisync-rs - A rust create for asynchronous reading of FASTA regions with index (.fai) files
  - pufferfish-rs A rust crate for the asynchronous reading of BGzip blocked data in memory or files
  - bubbles - A rust crate for asynchronous reading of BAM files with built in support for filtering
